## 3.Write a program that takes number and store in varaible and print this number power 5



## 1.Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 such that:
If the number is a multiple of 3, you need to print "Fizz" instead of that number.

If the number is a multiple of 5, you need to print "Buzz" instead of that number.

If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, you need to print "FizzBuzz" instead of that number.
